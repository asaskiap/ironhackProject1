                <div>
                    <p>&#129680 Muffin The Cat is on a mission in outer space, far away from her home planet. She is here to hunt for the elusive SPACEFISH &#128031! </p>
                    <p> &#129680 She must COLLECT 3 of them and make it home in time for DINNER.</p>

                    <p>&#129680 On her way she will encounter many treacherous distractions in form of ferns &#127793, boxes &#128230 and sunbeams - they will hinder her progress, so she must try to avoid them! </p>
                    <p>&#129680 By collecting MUFFINS, Muffin The Cat will gain extra speed and dash ability [SPACE] for jumping over sunbeams. </p>

                    <p>&#129680 She will also want to collect STARS for shooting power.</p>
                    <p>&#129680 Before she can make it home with her loot, Muffin The Cat will encounter an evil OCTOPUS named Monday who wants to steal her fish. She can defeat him with her shooting power [Y]! But she must avoid getting hit herself, or
                        Monday might succeed in taking her fish! </p>
                    <p>&#129680 And Muffin must be sure to manage everything before the TIMER runs out!! </p>
